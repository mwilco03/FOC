# ðŸ§­ Networking Protocols & Routing Concepts â€“ **Lab-Focused CLI Guide**

**Objective:**
Build expert-level proficiency in identifying routing issues, interpreting protocol behavior, and applying Cisco IOS/packet analysis commands. Covers OSPF, BGP, VLANs, MD5, and more with **commands, outputs, anomalies, and remediation**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ SECTION 1: OSPF â€“ Link-State Routing

### âœ… **1.1 Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) & Adjacency Formation**

**Use Case:** Verify OSPF neighbors and LSDB consistency.

```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
# Shows neighbor states (e.g., FULL, 2WAY)
# EXPECTED: Neighbor is FULL with correct Router ID
# ANOMALOUS: State stuck in INIT or 2WAY âžœ Timer or Area ID mismatch
```

```bash
show ip ospf database
# Displays OSPF LSAs in LSDB
# EXPECTED: LSA Types 1â€“5 populated
# ANOMALOUS: Missing Type 1/3 from neighbor âžœ Adjacency not formed
```

---

### âœ… **1.2 Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (SPF)**

**Use Case:** Understand shortest path decisions.

```bash
show ip route ospf
# Shows calculated OSPF routes based on SPF algorithm
# EXPECTED: OSPF routes marked with "O", correct next-hop IP
# ANOMALOUS: Missing or suboptimal route âžœ Loopback not advertised or LSA missing
```

---

### âœ… **1.3 Reference Bandwidth Configuration**

**Use Case:** Align OSPF cost with modern bandwidth.

```bash
router ospf 1
 auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
# EXPECTED: Cost adjusts based on real link speed (e.g., 10Gbps = cost 1)
# ANOMALOUS: Unchanged cost across high-speed links âžœ Config missing or not saved
```

---

### âœ… **1.4 OSPF Authentication (MD5)**

**Use Case:** Secure routing sessions and verify integrity.

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip ospf authentication message-digest
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 SECUREPASS
```

```bash
show ip ospf interface GigabitEthernet0/1
# EXPECTED: "Message digest authentication enabled", Key ID 1
# ANOMALOUS: "No authentication" âžœ Config missing, wrong key, or only one side configured
```

```bash
debug ip ospf adj
# EXPECTED: Normal hello/exchange/logs
# ANOMALOUS: "Invalid MD5 digest" âžœ Key mismatch or no auth on neighbor
```

---

### âœ… **1.5 Specialized OSPF Configs (Stub Areas, Hello Packets)**

```bash
show ip ospf interface brief
# EXPECTED: Area ID and state visible
# ANOMALOUS: Incorrect area â†’ Neighbor in INIT or no adjacency
```

```bash
show run | include ospf
# EXPECTED: Authentication, area config, reference-bandwidth all shown
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ SECTION 2: BGP â€“ Path Vector Protocol

### âœ… **2.1 BGP Overview & Path Selection**

```bash
show ip bgp
# EXPECTED: Prefixes, Next-hop, AS PATH, WEIGHT, MED
# ANOMALOUS: Incomplete ORIGIN or long AS_PATH âžœ Less preferred route
```

```bash
show ip bgp summary
# EXPECTED: State = Established, Prefix count > 0
# ANOMALOUS: Idle or Active âžœ Peer config error or TCP port 179 blocked
```

---

### âœ… **2.2 BGP Path Attribute Preference (Cisco Order)**

| Preference Order | Attribute          | Preferred Value        |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1                | Weight (Cisco)     | Higher                 |
| 2                | Local Preference   | Higher                 |
| 3                | AS Path Length     | Shorter                |
| 4                | Origin Type        | IGP > EGP > Incomplete |
| 5                | MED                | Lower                  |
| 6                | eBGP over iBGP     | eBGP preferred         |
| 7                | Lowest Next-Hop IP | Lower IP               |
| 8                | Oldest Route       | More stable            |

---

### âœ… **2.3 Internal vs External BGP (iBGP vs eBGP)**

| Feature             | iBGP            | eBGP       |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Scope               | Within AS       | Between AS |
| Next-Hop Changed?   | No (default)    | Yes        |
| Full Mesh Required? | Yes (unless RR) | No         |

**Use Case: Next-hop issues or iBGP loop prevention**

```bash
neighbor 10.0.0.2 route-reflector-client
# Use for iBGP RR to reduce full mesh
```

---

### âœ… **2.4 Route Reflectors & Scaling**

```bash
show ip bgp
# EXPECTED: RR clients receive all eligible paths
# ANOMALOUS: RR doesnâ€™t reflect âžœ RR misconfigured or cluster ID conflict
```

**Best Practices:**

* Design clusters by function or region
* Use multiple RRs per cluster for redundancy
* Avoid route feedback loops via cluster IDs

---

## ðŸ”¹ SECTION 3: Switching & VLANs

### âœ… **3.1 VLAN Creation and Trunking**

```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet0/0 - 1
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
```

```bash
show vlan brief
# EXPECTED: Ports in correct VLANs
# ANOMALOUS: Ports in VLAN 1 âžœ VLAN config missing
```

```bash
show mac address-table
# EXPECTED: MACs appear per port and VLAN
# ANOMALOUS: Same MAC on multiple ports âžœ MAC spoofing or virtual switch
```

---

### âœ… **3.2 Port Security & Quarantine**

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/5
 switchport access vlan 999
 shutdown
```

```bash
show port-security interface GigabitEthernet0/5
# EXPECTED: Secure MAC address bound
# ANOMALOUS: No secure MAC or violation mode âžœ Not configured
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ SECTION 4: Protocol Tools & Traffic Capture

### âœ… **4.1 ICMP, ARP, DHCP, DNS Behavior**

```bash
ping 192.168.1.1
# EXPECTED: Replies from router
# ANOMALOUS: No reply âžœ ACL, VLAN misconfig, or routing issue
```

```bash
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
# EXPECTED: Detects all online hosts
# ANOMALOUS: Missing hosts âžœ Switch not forwarding or host firewalled
```

---

### âœ… **4.2 Wireshark Filters & Analysis**

```wireshark
ip.src == 10.0.0.5 and !(arp or icmp)
# EXPECTED: TCP/UDP traffic from filtered host
```

```wireshark
ospf.auth == 2
# EXPECTED: MD5 auth in Hello packets
# ANOMALOUS: auth == 0 âžœ No authentication configured
```

| No ping to VLAN    | `ping`                   | ACL, VLAN missing, or port not active | Validate VLAN and trunk setup |
| No LSAs in DB      | `show ip ospf database`  | No adjacency                          | Check Hello packets and auth  |
