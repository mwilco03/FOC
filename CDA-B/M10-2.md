## ‚úÖ **Module 10 ‚Äì Lesson 2: Routing**

This lesson explains how switches and routers operate at **Layer 3 of the OSI model**, enabling **packet routing** between networks. It covers:

* Routing logic
* ARP and forwarding
* Static vs. dynamic routing
* Layer 3 switch configuration

---

### üß† **Key Concepts and Explanations**

---

### üåç **1. Layer 3 Forwarding (Routing Basics)**

* **Routers and multilayer switches** forward **IP packets** between **subnets/networks**.
* Routing decisions use the **Routing Table (RIB)**.
* Distinct from Layer 2 (MAC), Layer 3 uses **IP addresses**.

#### Data Flow

1. **Encapsulation** occurs top-down from Layer 7 to 1.
2. If the destination is **on the same subnet**, the device:

   * Checks its **ARP table** for destination MAC.
   * Sends a **frame** directly.
3. If the destination is **on a different subnet**, the device:

   * Uses its **default gateway** or next-hop.
   * Uses **ARP** to resolve the **MAC of the gateway**.
   * Sends frame to gateway (not directly to final host).

---

### üìã **2. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

* Used to map **IP ‚ûù MAC**.
* When MAC is unknown:

  * A **broadcast ARP request** is sent: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`.
  * The destination host replies with its MAC.
  * The sender updates its **ARP cache**.

#### Example: ARP Entry

```bash
PC1 wants to reach 192.168.1.5
ARP Request: Who has 192.168.1.5?
192.168.1.5 replies with its MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

* ARP entries **expire** (default \~240 min).

---

### üîÅ **3. Routing Steps for Remote Networks**

* **Step 1**: PC detects destination is **not local** (based on subnet mask).
* **Step 2**: Checks **routing table** to find next-hop.
* **Step 3**: Looks up MAC address of next-hop via **ARP**.
* **Step 4**: Sends packet (Ethernet frame) to router.

---

### üîé **4. Multilayer Switch (L3 Switch) Behavior**

* Can forward at Layer 2 **and** route at Layer 3.
* Faster than traditional routers (less overhead).
* Often used for **VLAN interconnection**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **5. Cisco L3 Interface Configuration**

#### üßæ **Assign IP to VLAN interface (SVI)**

```bash
S1(config)#interface Vlan 40
S1(config-if)#ip address 172.16.22.1 255.255.255.0
S1(config-if)#no shutdown
```

> ‚úÖ VLAN interface (SVI) must have at least one **active port** in that VLAN to be operational.

#### üßæ **Convert a Layer 2 port to Layer 3**

```bash
S1(config)#interface Gi1/0/14
S1(config-if)#no switchport
S1(config-if)#ip address 10.20.20.1 255.255.255.0
S1(config-if)#ipv6 address 2001:db8:20::1/64
S1(config-if)#no shutdown
```

### üß† **6. Routing Concepts Summary Table**

| Concept                          | Description                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **RIB**                          | Routing Information Base (Routing Table)    |
| **SVI**                          | Switched Virtual Interface for VLAN routing |
| **Direct Route**                 | Connected networks (no gateway)             |
| **Static Route**                 | Manually defined route                      |
| **Dynamic Route**                | Learned via protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)   |
| **AD (Administrative Distance)** | Trustworthiness rating (lower = preferred)  |

### üß™ **7. Hands-On and Lab Examples**

The lesson includes lab steps like:

* **Pinging hosts on VLAN 20** using terminal.

```bash
$ ping 172.16.1.13
```

* **Nmap** scan to detect live hosts:

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sn 172.16.1.0/24
```

> `-sn` = "ping scan" only (no port scan).

### ‚ùì **Knowledge Check Examples**

**Q: What does an ARP request target when the MAC address is unknown?**
‚úÖ The broadcast address `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`.

**Q: Which command configures a port as routed (L3)?**
‚úÖ `no switchport`

**Q: What is a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI)?**
‚úÖ A virtual interface used to assign an IP to a VLAN for Layer 3 routing.
